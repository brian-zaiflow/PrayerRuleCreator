            O most Holy Theotokos, look upon us with thy tender mercy. Heal the
            wounds of our hearts; grant us clarity of mind, humility, and
            understanding. If it is God’s will, open the way for reconciliation;
            but if not, give us peace, acceptance, and growth along our paths.
            Intercede for us before thy Son, that he may guide our hearts and
            bless our lives. Amen.

          <div class="section-content">
            O Lord of goodness and mercy, I know that my happiness depends on
            the love of thee with all my heart and soul. Guide my soul and fill
            my heart, O my Maker and God, for my desire is to please thee alone.
            Preserve me from pride, self-love, and laziness. Clothe me with
            reason, modesty, and chastity. And as thou didst bless the estate of
            marriage by thy presence in Cana, and commanded mankind to be
            fruitful and multiply, so also enable me to fulfill this holy
            calling; not to satisfy my desires, but to fulfill thy holy purpose.
            For thou hast said: It is not good for man to be alone, but thou
            madest a woman to help him. Hear my humble prayer from the depths of
            my heart, and grant me an honorable and godly spouse, that we may
            live together in love, with one mind, to thy glory, O compassionate
            God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of
            ages. Amen.

            O Lord Jesus Christ our God, who didst lead the people of Israel in
            a land unsown, a land of drought and deep darkness, a land none may
            pass through or dwell in: do thou, the same Lord, lead me all the
            days of my life, giving me to discern the times and their signs, and
            to redeem time's passage—for the days are evil—guiding me in the way
            that I should go, that I may ever say: I love thee, O Lord, for thou
            hast heard the voice of my supplication from my mother's womb, yea,
            from all eternity, and thou art the Way and the Truth, and the
            Resurrection and the Life, the Sunshine that ripens all who live and
            repose in thee, the Peace of God, and also our Peace with him:
            always, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.
